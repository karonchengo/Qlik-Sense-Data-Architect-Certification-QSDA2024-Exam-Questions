Answer: C</p>

<p>2. A data architect needs to acquire social media data for the past 10 years. The data architect needs to track all changes made to the source data, include all relevant fields, and reload the application four times a day.<br />
What information does the data architect need?<br />
A.A field with social media source, a set of key fields to sort out updated records, configure reload task to load four times a day<br />
B.A field with record creation time, a secondary key field to remove deleted records, configure reload task to load four times a day<br />

D.A field with ModificationTime, a primary key field to sort out updated records, insert and update records, remove records<br />
Answer: D</p>

<p>3. A data architect inherits an app that takes too long to load and overruns the data load window.<br />
The app pulls all records (new and historical) from three large databases. The reload process puts a heavy load on the source database servers. All of the data is required for analysis.<br />
What should the data architect do?<br />
A.Make sure the individual reload tasks in the QMC are not running in parallel<br />
B.Implement Direct Discovery with partial load<br />
C.Implement incremental load on each database using QVD files<br />
D.Implement ODAG to split out the app into smaller chunks<br />
Answer: C</p>

<p>4. A data architect needs to develop three separate apps (Sales, Finance, and Operations). The three apps share numerous identical calculation expressions.<br />
The goals include:<br />
● Reducing duplicate script<br />
● Saving time on expression modifications<br />
● Increasing reusable Qlik developer assets.<br />
The data architect creates a common script and stores it on a file server that Qlik Sense can access. How should the data architect complete the requirements?<br />
A.Macro on server<br />
B.Execute server script<br />
C.Include script function<br />
D.Call batch file<br />
Answer: C</p>
